An AI-powered generative engineering system that designs, validates, and documents custom FPV drones from natural language requirements.

---

**OpenForge is an AI-powered Hardware Compiler.** It transforms high-level, natural language requests into fully engineered, flight-ready drone designs.

Unlike standard chatbots that often hallucinate hardware specifications, OpenForge utilizes a **Cyber-Physical Agentic Workflow**. It interviews the user, browses the real-time internet for available components, reads technical diagrams using Computer Vision, validates the design for conceptual and geometric compatibility, generates manufacturing files (CAD), and renders an interactive 3D Digital Twin.

Most importantly, OpenForge is **resilient**. When it encounters design flaws or sourcing failures, it autonomously diagnoses the problem and enters a self-correction loop to find a viable solution.



## 🚀 Features

#### 1. Dynamic, Multi-Agent Engineering Core
*   **The Architect:** Analyzes user intent to dynamically determine all required component categories (e.g., adds a `Companion_Computer` for autonomy, a `GPS_Module` for long range, etc.), moving beyond static templates.
*   **The Sourcing Engineer:** Generates specific, context-aware search queries for the dynamically generated parts list.
*   **The Master Builder:** Acts as a quality control expert, analyzing the sourced parts for conceptual compatibility before any CAD is generated.
*   **The Optimization Engineer:** Diagnoses design failures (`conceptual`, `geometric`, or `sourcing`) and formulates a precise recovery strategy.

#### 2. Autonomous Validation & Self-Correction
*   **Agentic Loop:** The system is not a linear pipeline but a resilient loop. It iterates on a design until all validation checks pass.
*   **"Nuke and Rebuild" Strategy:** For fundamentally flawed designs (e.g., a mix of industrial and hobby-grade parts), the AI intelligently scraps the entire Bill of Materials and re-architects the build around a new, known-good "anchor" component.

#### 3. Fusion Sourcing Engine
*   **Real-Time Search:** Scrapes the web for currently available components and prices, avoiding outdated or out-of-stock parts.
*   **Generative Vision AI:** Uses a "Vision Prompt Engineer" (a meta-AI) to dynamically generate analysis prompts for any component type. This allows the system to extract critical specs like mounting patterns and dimensions from product images, even for parts it has never seen before.

#### 4. Physics, Fabrication, and Digital Twin
*   **Physics Simulation:** Calculates Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR), Disk Loading, and estimated flight time based on the validated Bill of Materials.
*   **Generative CAD:** Procedurally generates OpenSCAD scripts and STL files based on the specific dimensions of the sourced parts.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** The final output is a WebGL (Three.js) Digital Twin featuring an animated, step-by-step assembly guide, a complete Bill of Materials with links, and flight telemetry charts.

## 🛠️ Architecture

OpenForge operates not as a simple pipeline, but as a resilient, multi-agent system with a core validation loop.

## 📦 Installation

#### Prerequisites
*   **Python 3.10+**
*   **OpenSCAD:** The command-line tool must be installed and in your system's PATH.
    *   **Linux:** `sudo apt install openscad`
    *   **Mac:** `brew install --cask openscad`
    *   **Windows:** Download installer from [openscad.org](https://openscad.org/downloads.html)
*   **Google AI API Key**

#### Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/openforge.git
    cd openforge
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    playwright install  # Installs browsers for the web scraper
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    *   Add your Google AI API key:
    ```.env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
    GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="your_cse_id_here" # Required for component search
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage

Run the main entry point and follow the interactive prompts.

```sh
python3 main.py
```

1.  **Intake:** Enter your high-level mission requirements (e.g., "A rugged 5-inch freestyle drone for under $400").
2.  **Interview:** The AI will ask clarifying questions if needed.
3.  **Processing:** Watch the console as the agents design, source, validate, and self-correct the build.
4.  **Result:** A browser window will automatically open displaying the final, validated Digital Twin.

All generated artifacts are saved to the `output/` directory, including the `dashboard.html`, all `*.stl` files, and the `master_record.json` audit trail.
