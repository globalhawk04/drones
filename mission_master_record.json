An Octocopter (8 motors) class is chosen for redundancy and payload capacity. The extreme flight time requirement mandates a high-voltage (12S) system paired with large, efficient propellers (17-inch class) and a high-energy-density battery pack (likely Li-Ion). The frame must be large-format carbon fiber for rigidity. The video system is specified as two parts: a standard digital FPV link for the pilot and a separate custom solution for the advanced sensor payload, as this is not an integrated off-the-shelf system."

The powertrain will be a high-voltage 12S Li-Ion system for maximum flight time. Fabrication will involve CNC-milled carbon fiber plates and 3D printed components (e.g., ASA/Nylon) for electronics enclosures and mounting solutions. All 3D printed structural components will be fastened using M3 heat-set brass inserts and stainless steel hardware for maximum reliability and serviceability. To meet the specified ingress protection requirement, all wiring will be protected with mesh sleeving, major connections will be direct-soldered, and all critical electronics (flight controller, ESCs) will receive a conformal coating to resist moisture and dust.",

      "guide_md": "# Assembly Guide: 5-Inch Freestyle Drone\n\nThis guide outlines the assembly for your custom 5-inch freestyle quadcopter featuring the SpeedyBee F7 V3 stack and XING-E Pro 2207 motors.\n\n## 1. Preparation\n\nEnsure you have the following tools before starting:\n- Soldering Iron (with a fine tip)\n- Hex Drivers (typically 2.0mm, 2.5mm)\n- Wire cutters and strippers\n- Solder (63/37 recommended)\n\n## 2. Frame & Motor Assembly\n\nFirst, assemble the main plate and arms of your 5-inch frame according to its specific instructions. Mount the **XING-E Pro 2207 motors** to the end of each arm using the M3 screws provided with the motors. The standard mounting pattern for this motor size is 16x16mm.\n\n## 3. Electronics Stack Installation\n\nInstall the grommets into your frame's mounting holes. Carefully place the ESC board from your **SpeedyBee F7 V3 BL32 50A Stack** onto the 30.5x30.5mm mounting posts, followed by the flight controller. Ensure the arrow on the flight controller is pointing forward and the side-mounted USB port is accessible for later configuration.\n\n## 4. Wiring\n\nSolder the three wires from each motor to the corresponding motor pads on the corners of the ESC board. The order determines the initial spin direction, which can be reversed in software later. Connect your VTX and receiver to the designated pads on the flight controller.\n\n## 5. Configuration Tip\n\nWhen you are ready to configure the drone in Betaflight Configurator, connect the flight controller to your computer via USB. The correct firmware target for your board is **`SPEEDYBEEF7V3`**.",
